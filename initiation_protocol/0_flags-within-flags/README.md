# Flags Within Flags

Your journey with Y-CTF begins with a playful challenge crafted by The Committee. Among several images of various national flags, one contains a hidden digital flagâ€”a secret code embedded within its data. This test is not just about observing but also about thinking creatively and spotting the unusual in the familiar. Successfully discovering the hidden flag amidst the visual pun will prove your ability to discern and decode hidden messages, a vital skill in cybersecurity.

Sift through the collection of flag images and extract the digital flag cleverly embedded in one of them. This task will demonstrate your keen observational skills and your aptitude for uncovering hidden information.
