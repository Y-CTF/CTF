# The Y-CTF Initiation Protocol

Welcome to Y-CTF, HEIG-VD's premier ethical hacking club. As part of your initiation, you're about to undertake a series of challenges devised by "The Committee," a group of seasoned club members dedicated to inducting new hackers. These challenges are designed not only to test your skills but to immerse you in the collaborative and innovative spirit of Y-CTF. Prove your mettle, and you’ll earn your place among the ranks of past and present cybersecurity enthusiasts.

## Challenge 1: Flags Within Flags

Narrative: Your journey with Y-CTF begins with a playful challenge crafted by The Committee. Among several images of various national flags, one contains a hidden digital flag—a secret code embedded within its data. This test is not just about observing but also about thinking creatively and spotting the unusual in the familiar. Successfully discovering the hidden flag amidst the visual pun will prove your ability to discern and decode hidden messages, a vital skill in cybersecurity.

Objective: Sift through the collection of flag images and extract the digital flag cleverly embedded in one of them. This task will demonstrate your keen observational skills and your aptitude for uncovering hidden information.

Hint: Sometimes the end is only the beginning.

## Challenge 2: Overflowing Ambitions

Narrative: Building on your success in uncovering hidden information, your next challenge is to exploit a known vulnerability. The Committee has provided you with a simple program that contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. Your task is to exploit this flaw to run arbitrary code, teaching you about software weaknesses and the importance of secure coding practices.

Objective: Exploit the buffer overflow in the provided code to execute the hidden code and retrieve the next clue.

## Challenge 3: Cipher's Secrets

Narrative: Having demonstrated your technical prowess, The Committee now tests your cryptographic skills. A message encrypted with the Vigenère cipher needs to be decrypted using a hint provided by The Committee. This challenge will deepen your understanding of encryption and decryption techniques, key components of protecting data.

Objective: Decrypt the Vigenère cipher using the provided hint to reveal the encrypted message and advance to the final challenge.
